# Tutorial for creating your personal website

1. Create a **new repository** on GitHub. Your repository should have a name pertaining to your website (**Ex.** my_website) and be public, at a minimum. You may also add a README file for new users of your repository, a .gitignore (template: R) to specify which files to track changes on, and a license (MIT) to tell others what they can and cannot do with your code.
