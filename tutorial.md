# Tutorial for creating your personal website

1. Create a **new repository** on GitHub. Your repository should have a name pertaining to your website (**Ex.** my_website) and be public, at a minimum. You may also add a README file for new users of your repository, a .gitignore (template: R) to specify which files to track changes on, and a license (MIT) to tell others what they can and cannot do with your code. 
2. Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to clone the repository to your local computer. This just means that the files you created on GitHub are stored in your computer's folders. Once this is done, you can edit your files on your local computer and send them back up to GitHub!
